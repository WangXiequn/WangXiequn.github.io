I am a Master's student at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), supervised by Professor Yu Zhang. My research focuses on improving the efficiency and adaptability of large-scale Al models, particularly in Large Language Models (post-training and PEFT) and continual learning.

My publications include:

- **PLAN: Proactive Low-Rank Allocation for Continual Learning.** Accepted by ICCV 2025.
- **Come Together, But Not Right Now: A Simple Strategy to Boost Low-Rank Adaptation.** Accepted by ICML 2025.
- **Nemesis: Normalizing the Soft-prompt Vectors of Vision-Language Models.** ICLR 2024 (Spotlight).
- **Image Sorting as a Probe of Physical Prior Encoding in Vision Models.** Under review.
